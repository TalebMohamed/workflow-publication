This module is copying the merge package from XWiki 3.2.1 (https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/tree/xwiki-platform-3.2.1/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-oldcore/src/main/java/com/xpn/xwiki/doc/merge ) and it's here so that we can implement a merge function on the documents for the workflow. The merge function was added in 3.2 M1, so it has big chances of working properly on 3.1.1.
